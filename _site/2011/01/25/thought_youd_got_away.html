<h1>thought that was all?</h1>
<p>So, that&#8217;s just the language. Let&#8217;s talk about the tools. We use two applications to make iOS apps. Those being XCode 3 and Interface Builder.</p>

	<tr>
		<td>XCode</td>
		<td> XCode is the tool you&#8217;ll be writing all your code in, you may have used Visual Studio or Eclipse before, it&#8217;s like that, but made by Apple. XCode is for handling all of the code aspects of writing your application; like your header (.h) and implementation (.m) files. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Interface Builder</td>
		<td> Interface Builder is the tool that handles all the design and hooking up between objects in UIKit/Cocoa it&#8217;s a completely seperate application, so in order that Interface Builder sees the latest versions of your header files you have to save them in XCode. </td>
