<h1>XCode 3</h1>
<p>XCode holds all your project files, you can see in there a few m files, a few h files a xib file and some other supporting files. I wouldnt worry about those.</p>
<p>The xib file is an InterfaceBuilder file, and it is what you use to connect objects together and to make your shiney interfaces. You can also spot a few frameworks included at the bottom.</p>
