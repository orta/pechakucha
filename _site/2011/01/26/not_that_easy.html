<h1>Alas, it&#8217;s not that easy.</h1>
<p>We&#8217;re working with a <span class="caps">GUI</span>, and that means you&#8217;ve got a lot more things to think about. So before we get started on what additional syntax we have to deal with iOS dev, we&#8217;re going to have to get some words right.</p>

		<td>Objective-C</td>
		<td> Objective-C is a programming language, a lot like C++. It&#8217;s got a few tricks up its sleeve that gives it some advantages over C++ at the expense of some speed. It&#8217;s really only used on Mac OS X and iOS.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Frameworks or Libraries</td>
		<td> A framework or library is a collection of classes made for you to use, in C++ you probably use std as your library, and in Java, well, I guess you used Java&#8217;s native classes.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>UIKit</td>
		<td> UIKit is the framework that gives us all the shiney touch controls, and provides access to everything from the accelerometer to the speakers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cocoa</td>
		<td> Cocoa is the framework that UIKit is built off, when you see classes beginning with NS they come from Cocoa. Like NSString. Cocoa&#8217;s been around since the NextStep days in the 80s.</td>

		<td>#</td>
